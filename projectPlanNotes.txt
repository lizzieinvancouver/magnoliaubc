Magnolia phenology
	Compile all the data into one file
	Put it on a repo and share with Lizzie and Adriana
Add a readme!
Make some scatterplots
	1 plot of mean min max annual, in one figure
	Then do the same for the 4 climatological periods, the three month periods like JFM, AMJ, JAS, OND
	Is the spring unique or is it just not warming in Vancouver?
		Verify if other metrics have changed, and maybe just not spring
	Do the full series from the start of data collection to now, not just 1991 but the first year available
	Double check with an extra dataset that isn’t the airport (maybe find something from https://climexp.knmi.nl/getstations.cgi)
		Pull the GHCN site for airport data and make sure they’re the same
		GHCN would be cleaned for this airport data
Start a Git issue just for the climate data so that we can ensure that it’s all done before anything else
	Check GDD again and make sure its functional

Summarize which we have the most data on, species by phenophase like compiling all the M. campbellii etc.
